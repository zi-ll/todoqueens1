     <p>Our model is simple and based on GEORGE COURUS's philosophy that "Technology can never replace great teachers,
              but technology in the hands of a great teacher can be transformational" 
              Meaning Learning should never be technology led.Teachers teach, technology assists</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>A leveled playing field between rural and urban schools with increased access to low cost and high quality educational content for learners in Africa.</p>
